NAME			ROLL-NO	  CONTRIBUTION

I. N. DILIP KUMAR   -   150101027 (<program_name> m, ls, documentation, makefile, rm)  
L.S.SAI SHOBITH     -   150101032 (rm, rmexcept, documentation, <program_name> m, history n)
V.SONY VENKATESH    -   150101080 (cd, history n, issue n, rm, exit, ls)

COMMANDS IMPLEMENTED
cd, ls, rm, history n, issue n, <program_name> m, rmexcept, exit

COMMANDS		
usage: cd <directory_name>
--------------------------
changes the current directory to the specific directory
<directory_name> can be absolute or relative path w.r.t currrent directory 


usage: ls <directory_name>
---------------------------
lists information about files in the given directory 
if no <directory_name> is provided, lists files in the present directory
<directory_name> can be absolute or relative path w.r.t currrent directory 

usage: rm [-f -r -v] <files/directories> ...
---------------------------------------------
-v	print the name of the deleted files
-r 	recursively deletes the contents of the directory 
-f 	forcibly deletes the files without prompt

usage: history n
----------------------
lists the previous n recent number of commands 
if no n is provided prints whole history

usage: issue n
---------------------
runs the nth command in the history

usage: exit 
-------------------------------
exits the shell

usage: rmexcept <list_of_files>
-------------------------------
deletes all the contents of the current directory except the specified files.
(does not remove directories if they are not empty)

usage: <program_name> < <input_file> > <output_file> m
------------------------------------------------------
<input_file>, <output_file>, m are optional
takes input from <input_file>
takes output from <output_file>
stops the execution on <program_name> if time exceeds 'm' seconds.

DESCRIPTION OF CODE
the code has three functions and a main function
three functions-
(is_directory: tells whether a path is a directory or not)
(recu_del: deletes all contentents of a directory in depth first search pattern)
(kill_child: kills the child if time limit exceeds)
every command is executed by a child process except 'cd' and 'issue n'.

COMPILING AND RUNNING OF CODE
execute '$ make' to compile  the code
execute '$ ./os' to run the code
